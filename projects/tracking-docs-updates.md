Project name: Tracking Doc Suggestions / Updates

Initially proposed by: @kenshino

Description: We do not have a unified tracking system for when a doc needs updates. People do it on Meta Trac (which is really for code changes to WordPress.org), report them on Slack, and sometimes via Twitter. It’s impossible for people to know if a doc is going through updates or is simply outdated. Some projects use Trello for short term purposes. Some projects use GitHub.

We really ought to have a unified tracking system so that we can track these requests and the work to fulfill such requests. And we need to create a process to utilize this system properly.



### Create a system to track updates and suggestions to the WordPress documentation - WordPress

### About your organization

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP. WordPress is currently used by 40.7% of all the websites, according to [W3Techs reports](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management).

WordPress is also a large and active community of contributors spread around the world, and organized by contribution team (including the documentation team).

### About your project


#### Your project’s problem

_Tell us about the problem your project will help solve. Why is it important to your organization or project to solve this problem?_


#### Your project’s scope

_Tell us about what documentation your organization will create, update, or improve. If some work is deliberately not being done, include that information as well. Include a time estimate, and whether you have already identified organization volunteers and a technical writer to work with your project._


#### Measuring your project’s success

_How will you know that your new documentation has helped solve your problem? What metrics will you use, and how will you track them?_


### Project budget

#### General guidelines

*   You can include your budget in your proposal, or as a separate link. If your budget is fewer than ten items, we recommend including it in your proposal.
*   All budgets should be in US dollars. We expect grants to range from US$5000 to US$15000; if your project is outside of that range, please provide additional information to justify your budget.
*   We expect the bulk of your budget (60-70% minimum) to be allocated to the technical writer working on your project. We recommend budgeting on a per-project basis wherever possible.
*   We expect open source projects to use open source tools whenever possible; if your project absolutely requires funds for proprietary software licenses or support, please include a justification for the amount.
*   Other possible expenses include:
    *   Design work to create branding, logos, templates, or other design assets for your documentation site
    *   Minimal amounts (&lt;US$200) for project swag (t-shirts or stickers for your participants). If you use the Season of Docs logo, it must be accompanied by your project or organization logo or name. Your swag may **not** use the name Google.
    *   Minimal stipends for volunteers who take on considerable mentorship or guidance roles in the project (we recommend no more than $500 per volunteer, please)
    *   Downstream donations to other open source projects should be no more than 10% of your budget total.
*   Include other budget items as needed, along with justification for the amount sought. Expense justifications should highlight how the expenditure will contribute to the success of the project as a whole.
