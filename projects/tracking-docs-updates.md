# Create a system to track updates and suggestions to the WordPress documentation
### About WordPress

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP. WordPress is currently used by 40.7% of all the websites, according to [W3Techs reports](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management).

WordPress is also a large and active community of contributors spread around the world, and organized by contribution team (including the documentation team).

### About the project
#### The problem

The WordPress documentation is huge and divided into multiple sections. There are user documentations, developer documentations of different projects (themes, plugins, block editor, APIs, etc.).

All these documentations are subject to frequent changes as the projects to which they belong evolve. So we end up with requests for changes, requests for updates that are frequently reported on various channels: Slack, Meta Trac, GitHub, etc.

The fact that we don't have a unified system for change requests and documentation updates makes collaboration difficult; and can be an obstacle for new contributors who want to start with documentation contribution. 

So, **WordPress really needs to have a unified tracking system so that we can track these requests and the work to fulfill such requests**. And we need to create a process to utilize this system properly.
#### Measuring the project’s success

The main indicator of success is the effective implementation of a system and process to report documentation that is obsolete, needs to be updated or corrected.

The second indicator of success is the use by contributors of the system and process implemented.

### Skills required

The technical writer who will work on this project should have an idea of the various WordPress documentations, how they work, and how the documentation team maintains them.

The technical writer will have a mentor with experience on the documentation team who can provide assistance and guidance as needed.

### Project budget

#### General guidelines

*   You can include your budget in your proposal, or as a separate link. If your budget is fewer than ten items, we recommend including it in your proposal.
*   All budgets should be in US dollars. We expect grants to range from US$5000 to US$15000; if your project is outside of that range, please provide additional information to justify your budget.
*   We expect the bulk of your budget (60-70% minimum) to be allocated to the technical writer working on your project. We recommend budgeting on a per-project basis wherever possible.
*   We expect open source projects to use open source tools whenever possible; if your project absolutely requires funds for proprietary software licenses or support, please include a justification for the amount.
*   Other possible expenses include:
    *   Design work to create branding, logos, templates, or other design assets for your documentation site
    *   Minimal amounts (&lt;US$200) for project swag (t-shirts or stickers for your participants). If you use the Season of Docs logo, it must be accompanied by your project or organization logo or name. Your swag may **not** use the name Google.
    *   Minimal stipends for volunteers who take on considerable mentorship or guidance roles in the project (we recommend no more than $500 per volunteer, please)
    *   Downstream donations to other open source projects should be no more than 10% of your budget total.
*   Include other budget items as needed, along with justification for the amount sought. Expense justifications should highlight how the expenditure will contribute to the success of the project as a whole.

#### Additional information

_Include here any additional information that is relevant to your proposal._

* **Previous experience with technical writers or documentation:**
  If you or any of your mentors have worked with technical writers before, or
  have developed documentation, mention this in your application. Describe
  the documentation that you produced and the ways in which you worked with the
  technical writer. For example, describe any review processes that you used, or
  how the technical writer's skills were useful to your project.
  Explain how this previous experience may help you to work
  with a technical writer in Season of Docs.

* **Previous participation in Season of Docs, Google Summer of Code or
  others:**
  If you or any of your mentors have taken part in
  [Google Summer of Code](https://g.co/gsoc) or a similar program, mention
  this in your application. Describe your achievements in that program. Explain
  how this experience may influence the way you work in Season of Docs.
